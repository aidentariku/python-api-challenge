This repository contains completed assignments for the Python API Challenge, which focuses on analyzing weather data and planning future vacations using Python, APIs, and data visualization techniques. The project is divided into two parts: WeatherPy and VacationPy. In WeatherPy, we visualize weather data for over 500 cities and analyze relationships between weather variables and latitude. VacationPy involves using weather data to plan vacations, utilizing maps and hotel information. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks for analysis, a file for API keys, and a .gitignore file to ensure sensitive information is not shared publicly. Follow the provided instructions to run the notebooks and explore the analyses.
